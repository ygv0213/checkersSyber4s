down below there is the project explanation video
----------------------------------------------------


bugs:
    1) quinns cant move
    2) posible moves allows quinns jump over there picecs
    3) if player is stuck the winning always go to white player
    4) winning is declered only if all other player was eaten

pitzurs to add:
    1) eat more then one piece in one turn
    2) block player moves if he can eat [the player can choose what he can to eat if there is multi eating option]
